My solution is for Option1.
### Option 1: FIND DUPLICATE
- Implement a function to identify a duplicate integer in an unsorted array. Ideally, you would write 2 different solutions with different time/space performance.
- Given an array of exactly $N+1$ numbers, where each of the numbers in range $[1,N]$ appears at least once, find the number that appears more than once.
- Write a sentence or two describing the performance of your solution(s).
- Write tests and attach their results in the repo to prove correctness.
- See [option1.cpp](./find-duplicate/option1.cpp) / [option1.py](./find-duplicate/option1.py) to get started (note that you may use any language, test frameworks, file structures, etc.) so long as your completion of the task is clear.
